# RealEngine

**RealEngine** is an in-development game engine built with the goal of providing developers a flexible and powerful platform to create both 2D and 3D games. While the engine is still under active development, it aims to combine user-friendly tools with a high level of performance. The engine is designed to be modular, giving developers the freedom to extend it as they see fit.

## Overview

RealEngine is a work-in-progress game engine that is designed to meet the needs of game developers looking for a lightweight, extensible, and high-performance platform for creating 2D and 3D games. The engine is still under development, but its core features are already functional, and more will be added over time. The engine draws inspiration from various game development frameworks and focuses on simplicity and ease of use for both novice and experienced developers.

Currently, RealEngine is optimized for developers who need a flexible toolset with room for expansion. It is designed to be a starting point for creating games with an emphasis on performance, customizability, and control over core systems.

## Current Features

RealEngine is still in active development, and some of the key features that have been implemented so far include:

- **Basic Engine Framework**  
  The core architecture of RealEngine is in place, providing the foundational structure for game development. This includes the engine loop, scene management, and basic file handling.

- **Scripting System**  
  A basic scripting interface is available, allowing you to add functionality to your games. It supports simple game logic, player interaction, and event-driven behavior.

- **Asset Management**  
  Basic asset management systems are in place, allowing you to load and use resources such as textures and sounds in your game.

- **Basic Rendering**  
  Basic 2D rendering functionality is available, with support for displaying images, handling sprites, and rendering basic shapes.

## Getting Started

To start using RealEngine, follow the steps below to set up your development environment:

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Software**:
  - RealEngine SDK (Download [here](#))
  - Text editor or IDE (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Download the RealEngine SDK** from the official website.
2. **Install the SDK** by following the instructions in the setup guide.
3. Open the RealEngine Editor and create a new project.

### Your First Project

Once you’ve set up the SDK, you can begin your first project. Currently, you can:

1. Create a new project in the RealEngine Editor.
2. Add a basic sprite and script a simple action (e.g., moving an object on the screen).
3. Run the project from the editor to test your game.

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [documentation](#documentation).

## Documentation

As RealEngine is still under development, the documentation is a work in progress. Currently, it covers the basics of setting up your environment and using the initial features:

- [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.md)
- [Scripting Basics](docs/scripting_basics.md)

### Note:
The documentation will be updated regularly as new features are added to RealEngine.
